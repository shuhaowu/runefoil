To get API server prices working:

- Option 1: run it the real way.
  - The API server relies on the `runelite-cache2` tables in order to crawl
    prices from the RS official API. The cache table is populated by
    cache-updater, which can be run via
    `java -jar target/cache-updater-1.5.4-spring-boot.jar` after compilation
    and some adjustments to `application.properties` to the correct values.
  - The cache-updater relies on minio, which is a bigger component
  - This discovers the list of tradable item ids via the OSRS cache (?) and
    populate the prices by picking one to update every 20 seconds on the
    server.
  - If the server is not running all the time, it could be problematic as
    everything will be out of date all the time.
- Option 2: import + patch
  - On every boot, update the price with OSB information.
  - Patch runelite so every fetchItem will update the price locally
  - The prices table has a time stamp for each item, allowing history tracking.
    - Runelite doesn't seem to use this.

- IMPORTANT FOR ITEM STATS
  - Clone https://github.com/runelite/static.runelite.net and serve it via
    nginx. Also requires patching in base.


We should shutdown tomcat8, nginx after runefoil.service shutdown in systemd.

runelite-forked-src diff with the tagged version, and then apply that patch to
/opt/runelite-src before compiling. Always apply the base runefoil patches,
tho.

Reinstall runefoil automatically if changed.
